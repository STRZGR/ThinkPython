    "*Again, I'm of the opinion that the difficulties in this chapter are due less to lack of programming ability/knowledge, and more to lack of familiarity with advanced geometry.  I.e., a fairly expert Python programmer could very well struggle with these exercises, which shouldn't be.  Also, the wikipedia links in the chapter are probably nowhere near as helpful as the author might think.  In order to graph these shapes, we need descriptions of the algorithms used to build them, and these are absent from the (current) wikis.*"
