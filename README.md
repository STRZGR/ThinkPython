# ThinkPython
My solutions to selected exercises in Allen Downey's <b>Think Python 2e</b>, viewable [here](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/).

In my solutions I have endeavored to use only those methods which have hitherto been presented in the book.  I will try to highlight those cases where it wasn't practical or optimal to do so.
