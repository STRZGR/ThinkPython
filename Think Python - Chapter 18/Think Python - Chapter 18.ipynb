    "    <li><b><i>In the 5-card game, if a hand has a straight and a flush, it is unvariably a straight flush.  That's not the case in the 7-card game: It's possible that the five cards which make a straight are not the same five which make a flush (e.g., 2C, 3C, 4C, 5D, 6H, 9C, 10C).  In this case, the hand would be a flush, as it's the higher ranked hand.  In the 5-card game, you can just create a method that will return <code>True</code> if the methods that find straights and flushes both return <code>True</code>; but that won't work with the 7-card hand, and consequently we need to craft some fairly complicated code to deal with this possibility.  A heads up would have been nice.</i></b></li>\n",
